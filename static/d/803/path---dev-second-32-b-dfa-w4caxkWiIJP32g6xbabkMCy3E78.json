In Asian\nsupermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted\ncharcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,\nwrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the\nsalted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a\nfirm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"./salty_egg.jpg\" alt=\"Chinese Salty Egg\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"test 1-2","categories":"dev","tags":null,"published":null,"date":"2015 05 01","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/dev/second/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/dev/gatsby/create-blog/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"react gatsby로 github 블로그 만들기!","categories":"dev","published":true,"date":"2019-05-02"}}}}
